# Final Project: Computational Tools for Data Science - Group 34

This repository contains the final project for the Computational Tools for Data Science course. The goal was to analyze gym user behavior using a dataset from Kaggle ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/gym-check-ins-and-user-metadata)) to provide actionable insights for gym owners.

## Key Analyses
- **Clustering**: Identified user profiles (e.g., "Weekend Warriors") using DBSCAN and evaluated cluster quality with Silhouette and Davies-Bouldin scores.
- **Classification**: Predicted workout preferences based on demographic features like age and gender.
- **Frequent Itemset Mining**: Uncovered peak attendance times and common check-in behaviors.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flagged irregular attendance patterns for retention strategy insights.

## Repository Structure
- **`data/`**: Processed datasets used in the analysis.
- **`scripts/`**: Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing, clustering, classification, and frequent itemset mining.
- **`plots/`**: Visualizations and figures generated during the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on gym check-ins, user metadata, and workout sessions, serving as the basis for clustering, classification, and behavioral pattern analysis.
